def depthFirstSearch(problem):

    Search the deepest nodes in the search tree first [p 85].

    Your search algorithm needs to return a list of actions that reaches the goal.
    Make sure to implement a graph search algorithm [Fig. 3.7].

    To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
    understand the search problem that is being passed in:
    ```
    print("Start: %s" % (str(problem.startingState())))
    print("Is the start a goal?: %s" % (problem.isGoal(problem.startingState())))
    print("Start's successors: %s" % (problem.successorStates(problem.startingState())))
